# My_JSF_Webcart
Maven based project. Used Java 8, JSF 2.2.9. Items are harcoded ( no database).
Created a web application with simple frontend, where user can add/remove products into his cart.
Cart displays total price and allows quantity changes. When total price exceeds 100$, a 10% discount is applied along with a notification.
Shipping costs are calculated via a fixed 5$ per item, multiplied by each items weight factor(0-1 range).
